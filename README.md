## Bash Pun
* Why only for ```bash```? *Legacy-Ultimatum* (would that be a Latin word? :wink: ) is to attain ```bash``` *Supremacy*, which has been the goal ever since I became aware of its *Identity*.  Also,
I am a big fan of *Bourne* movies! Get the Bourne-bash pun? :smile:
* ```.basha``` refers to ```.bashrc``` **a**ddons, but is also a pun on the iconic (Indian) cult movie character *Basha*! :star2:
